This program calculates the n'th term of the Fibonacci series in 2 different ways.
Method 1 : using a third temporary variable storing the sum of 2 terms
Method 2 : Using an array and storing all terms of the series and printing out the last term
For those who don't know, the Fibonacci series is a series of numbers in which the next number is the sum of the previous 2.
The series : 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21....
as we can see:
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
3 + 5 = 8
and so on...
